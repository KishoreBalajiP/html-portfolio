<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Kishore Balaji, a second-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at VIT-AP University. I have a strong passion for technology, especially in the field of web development, and I'm currently honing my skills in building dynamic, responsive websites and applications.</p>
<p>Alongside web development, I have a foundational understanding of multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, C, and C++, and I am proficient in SQL for database management. I enjoy working on coding projects that challenge my problem-solving abilities and expand my knowledge of software development.</p>
<p>Outside of academics, I’m a firm believer in maintaining a healthy lifestyle through regular workouts. I work out daily to stay fit and energized, which helps me maintain focus and productivity in my studies and other activities. I am also passionate about sports, particularly Cricket and Kabaddi, and had the privilege of captaining my school’s Kabaddi team to success in several tournaments. My sports experience has strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.</p>
<p>I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and push my limits in both technology and fitness. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or if you're looking to connect with someone who’s dedicated to growth, both academically and personally!</p>
